# Mini-Project-2017
we will implement a simple “four-function” calculator using stacks and queues. This calculator takes as input a space-delimited infix expression (e.g. 3+4*7), which you will convert to postfix notation and evaluate. There are four (binary) operators your calculator must handle: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). In addition, your calculator must handle the unary negation operator (also -). The usual order of operations is in effect:      the unary negation operator -has higher precedence than the binary operators, and is evaluated right-to-left (right-associative)   + and - have higher precedence than × and /  all binary operators are evaluated left-to-right (left-associative)
